# AI_PROJECT
## Summary
This project focuses on habitat classification using artificial intelligence techniques and visualizing misclassified habitats. The aim is to analyze how AI models classify different habitat types and to understand errors by visually inspecting misclassified samples. This helps improve model accuracy and ecological decision-making.

## Background
Habitat classification plays an important role in environmental monitoring, biodiversity conservation, and land-use planning. Traditional methods are time-consuming and prone to human error. Artificial intelligence and machine learning provide efficient ways to automatically classify habitats using data such as images or environmental features.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to build an AI-based habitat classification system and visualize the habitats that are misclassified by the model in order to analyze patterns and improve classification performance.

## Problem Statement
AI models may incorrectly classify habitats due to overlapping features, poor data quality, or limited training samples. Identifying and visualizing these misclassifications helps in understanding model weaknesses and improving future predictions.

## Methodology
- Data collection and preprocessing  
- Feature extraction from habitat data  
- Training a machine learning classification model  
- Evaluating model performance  
- Visualizing misclassified habitats for analysis  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning  
- Data Visualization  
- GitHub  

## Results and Discussion
The model successfully classifies most habitat types, while misclassified habitats are visualized to identify confusion between similar habitat categories. These visualizations provide insights into data limitations and model behavior.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be used for habitat classification and how visualization of misclassified habitats helps improve understanding and performance of AI models. It highlights the importance of explainability in environmental AI applications.

## Future Scope
Future improvements may include using deep learning models, larger datasets, satellite imagery, and advanced visualization techniques to enhance classification accuracy.
